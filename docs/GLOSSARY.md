# Plinth Terminology Glossary

This document defines key terms used throughout Plinth documentation and codebase. Consistent terminology prevents confusion during development.

---

## Core Concepts

### Decision
A strategic choice being evaluated through Plinth's structured process. Each decision belongs to one organization and has one owner. Decisions move through statuses: `draft` → `in_review` → `committed` → `archived`.

### Decision Frame
The specific question a decision is trying to answer. Should be actionable and specific, e.g., "Should we build a custom CRM or purchase Salesforce for our enterprise sales team?"

### Decision Canvas
The main UI view where users work on a decision. Contains all six sections (Frame, Context, Options, Evidence, Tradeoffs, Recommendation) in a navigable interface.

### Decision Type / Template
The category of decision being made. Plinth has four built-in templates: `build_vs_buy`, `market_entry`, `investment`, `product_prioritization`, plus a `custom` type.

### Quality Score
A 0-100% score indicating how complete a decision is. Calculated from section completion. Must reach 80%+ before generating a brief.

---

## Decision Components

### Option
One possible path forward for a decision. Each decision should have 2-10 options. Options have:
- Title and description
- Pros (advantages)
- Cons (disadvantages)
- Risks (potential negative outcomes)
- AI analysis (cached analysis results)

### Evidence
A factual claim that supports or challenges one or more options. Evidence has:
- Claim (the factual statement)
- Source URL and type
- Strength (`strong`, `moderate`, `weak`)
- Option links (which options it supports/challenges)

Note: Evidence can link to MULTIPLE options via the `evidence_options` junction table.

### Constraint
A non-negotiable boundary that any viable option must respect. Types:
- `hard` - Must be satisfied (deal-breaker if violated)
- `soft` - Prefer to satisfy (can be compromised if necessary)

Categories: `legal`, `technical`, `budget`, `timeline`, `brand`, `org`, `other`

### Tradeoff
An explicit acknowledgment of what is being given up to gain something else. Format: "By choosing [option], we give up [X] to get [Y]."

Tradeoffs must be `acknowledged` before generating a brief.

### Stakeholder
A person or group who has interest in or influence over the decision. Tracked with:
- Name and role
- Stance (`supportive`, `neutral`, `skeptical`, `unknown`)
- Concerns

### Competitor Profile
An AI-generated analysis of a competitor company, created as evidence for a decision. Contains structured data about company overview, product, market position, strengths, weaknesses, etc.

---

## Output Artifacts

### Decision Brief
The primary output artifact. A structured document summarizing the decision, recommendation, and rationale. Generated by AI when quality score reaches 80%+.

### Output
Database entity representing a generated artifact. MVP supports only `brief` type. Has status (`pending`, `generating`, `complete`, `failed`) and can be shared via unique URL.

### Share Key
A unique, URL-safe identifier for sharing outputs publicly. When shared, the output can be viewed without authentication at `/share/:shareKey`.

---

## Users & Organizations

### Organization (Org)
A tenant in the multi-tenant system. All data is isolated by org. Has a `plan` (`trial`, `team`, `enterprise`).

### Member
A user who belongs to an organization. Has a `role`:
- `admin` - Full access, can invite/remove members
- `member` - Can create and edit decisions
- `viewer` - Read-only access

### Owner
The user who created a decision. Has special permissions (e.g., can delete).

### Invitation
A pending org invite sent to an email address. Expires after 7 days.

---

## Technical Terms

### RLS (Row Level Security)
Postgres feature that enforces data isolation at the database level. Ensures users can only access their own org's data.

### Job
A background task for async operations (competitor analysis, brief generation, etc.). Has status (`pending`, `running`, `completed`, `failed`) and progress (0-100).

### Inngest
The background job processing service used for long-running AI tasks.

### Firecrawl
Web scraping API used to extract content from competitor websites.

### Exa
AI-powered search API used for gathering market research and evidence.

---

## AI Concepts

### Prompt
A structured instruction sent to the LLM (GPT-4o). Each prompt has:
- System prompt (role and guidelines)
- User prompt template (task-specific with variable injection)
- Output schema (Zod validation for structured output)

### Structured Output
JSON responses from the LLM that conform to a predefined schema. Validated using Zod.

### AI Analysis
Cached results from AI analysis of an option (pros, cons, risks). Stored in `options.ai_analysis` JSONB field.

### AI Context
Template-specific context injected into AI prompts to tailor analysis to the decision type.

---

## Status & Workflow Terms

### Draft
Initial decision status. Decision is being built and is not ready for review.

### In Review
Decision is being reviewed by stakeholders. May be shared for feedback.

### Committed
A decision has been made. The recommended option has been selected and tradeoffs acknowledged.

### Archived
Decision is no longer active. Soft-deleted for record-keeping.

---

## UI/UX Terms

### Empty State
UI displayed when a section has no content yet. Includes helpful prompts and call-to-action.

### Skeleton Screen
Loading state that shows the shape of content before it loads. Preferred over spinners.

### Toast
Brief notification message that appears and auto-dismisses. Used for confirmations and non-blocking errors.

### Modal / Dialog
Overlay UI for focused tasks like creating options, confirming actions, or viewing AI analysis.

## Naming Conventions

### Database
- Tables: `snake_case`, plural (`decisions`, `options`, `evidence`)
- Columns: `snake_case` (`decision_id`, `created_at`)
- Foreign keys: `<related_table_singular>_id` (`decision_id`, `user_id`)

### Code (TypeScript)
- Types/Interfaces: `PascalCase` (`Decision`, `Option`, `EvidenceOption`)
- Variables/Functions: `camelCase` (`decisionId`, `createOption`)
- Constants: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` (`MAX_OPTIONS`, `API_BASE_URL`)

### API
- Endpoints: `kebab-case` (`/api/decisions`, `/api/ai/analyze-competitor`)
- Query params: `camelCase` (`pageSize`, `decisionId`)
- Request/Response fields: `snake_case` (matching database)

### Files
- Components: `PascalCase.tsx` (`DecisionCanvas.tsx`, `OptionCard.tsx`)
- Utilities: `kebab-case.ts` (`use-decision.ts`, `format-date.ts`)
- API routes: `kebab-case` (`/api/decisions/[id]/route.ts`)
