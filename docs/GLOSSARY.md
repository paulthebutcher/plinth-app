# Plinth Terminology Glossary

> **Updated for v2 (Evidence-First Architecture)**
> See [CORE_JOURNEY.md](./specs/CORE_JOURNEY.md) for the canonical 9-step flow.

This document defines key terms used throughout Plinth documentation and codebase. Consistent terminology prevents confusion during development.

---

## Core Concepts

### Decision / Analysis
A strategic choice being evaluated through Plinth's 9-step process. Each decision belongs to one organization and has one owner. Analyses move through statuses: `draft` → `scanning` → `complete` → `tracking`.

### Decision Frame
The specific question a decision is trying to answer (Step 1). Should be actionable and specific, e.g., "Should we enter the mid-market with a lighter compliance SKU?"

### Analysis Flow
The main UI experience where users work through the 9-step evidence-first journey. Routes: `/analyze/[id]/frame` → `/context` → `/scanning` → `/options` → `/scoring` → `/recommend`. Replaces the v1 "Decision Canvas".

### Decision Type
The category of decision being made. Types: `product_bet`, `market_entry`, `investment`, `platform_architecture`, `org_operating`.

### Confidence Score
A 0-100 score indicating how strongly the evidence supports a recommendation. Calculated from 6 factors: evidence strength, recency, source reliability, corroboration, constraint fit, assumption risk. Replaces v1 "Quality Score".

## Decision Components

### Option
One possible path forward, **generated by AI** based on gathered evidence (Step 4). Each decision has 3-6 options. Options have:
- Title and description
- Commits to (what this option prioritizes)
- Deprioritizes (what this option sacrifices)
- Primary upside and risk
- Reversibility assessment

### Evidence
A factual signal gathered during the Evidence Scan (Step 3). Evidence has:
- Claim (the factual finding)
- Source URL and publication
- Confidence level (`high`, `medium`, `low`)
- Access date
- Category (`market`, `competitor`, `regulatory`, `internal`)

### Evidence Mapping
The relationship between evidence and options (Step 5). Each evidence item is classified as:
- `supporting` - Strengthens the case for an option
- `contradicting` - Weakens the case for an option
- `unknown` - Relevance unclear, needs investigation

### Constraint
A non-negotiable boundary provided during Context Anchoring (Step 2). Types:
- `hard` - Must be satisfied (deal-breaker if violated)
- `soft` - Prefer to satisfy (can be compromised if necessary)

Categories: `legal`, `technical`, `budget`, `timeline`, `brand`, `org`, `other`

### Assumption
A belief that must be true for a recommendation to hold. Tracked in the Assumptions Ledger:
- `declared` - User stated upfront
- `implicit` - AI surfaced during analysis
- Status: `untested`, `validated`, `invalidated`

### Decision Changer
A condition that would flip the recommendation (Step 7). Format: "If [condition], reconsider [option]." Monitored during tracking.

### Stakeholder
A person or group who has interest in or influence over the decision. Tracked with:
- Name and role
- Stance (`supportive`, `neutral`, `skeptical`, `unknown`)
- Concerns

### Competitor Profile
An AI-generated analysis of a competitor company, created as evidence for a decision. Contains structured data about company overview, product, market position, strengths, weaknesses, etc.

---

## Output Artifacts

### Decision Brief
The primary output artifact. A structured document summarizing the decision, recommendation, and rationale. Generated by AI when quality score reaches 80%+.

### Output
Database entity representing a generated artifact. MVP supports only `brief` type. Has status (`pending`, `generating`, `complete`, `failed`) and can be shared via unique URL.

### Share Key
A unique, URL-safe identifier for sharing outputs publicly. When shared, the output can be viewed without authentication at `/share/:shareKey`.

---

## Users & Organizations

### Organization (Org)
A tenant in the multi-tenant system. All data is isolated by org. Has a `plan` (`trial`, `team`, `enterprise`).

### Member
A user who belongs to an organization. Has a `role`:
- `admin` - Full access, can invite/remove members
- `member` - Can create and edit decisions
- `viewer` - Read-only access

### Owner
The user who created a decision. Has special permissions (e.g., can delete).

### Invitation
A pending org invite sent to an email address. Expires after 7 days.

---

## Technical Terms

### RLS (Row Level Security)
Postgres feature that enforces data isolation at the database level. Ensures users can only access their own org's data.

### Job
A background task for async operations (competitor analysis, brief generation, etc.). Has status (`pending`, `running`, `completed`, `failed`) and progress (0-100).

### Inngest
The background job processing service used for long-running AI tasks.

### Firecrawl
Web scraping API used to extract content from competitor websites.

### Exa
AI-powered search API used for gathering market research and evidence.

---

## AI Concepts

### Prompt
A structured instruction sent to the LLM (GPT-4o). Each prompt has:
- System prompt (role and guidelines)
- User prompt template (task-specific with variable injection)
- Output schema (Zod validation for structured output)

### Structured Output
JSON responses from the LLM that conform to a predefined schema. Validated using Zod.

### AI Analysis
Cached results from AI analysis of an option (pros, cons, risks). Stored in `options.ai_analysis` JSONB field.

### AI Context
Template-specific context injected into AI prompts to tailor analysis to the decision type.

---

## Status & Workflow Terms

### Draft
Initial analysis status. User is framing the decision (Steps 1-2).

### Scanning
Analysis is actively gathering evidence (Step 3). AI is searching and scraping sources.

### Complete
Analysis finished. Recommendation generated (Steps 4-8). Ready for sharing or tracking.

### Tracking
Post-decision monitoring active (Step 9). Assumptions being watched for changes.

### Archived
Decision is no longer active. Soft-deleted for record-keeping.

---

## UI/UX Terms

### Empty State
UI displayed when a section has no content yet. Includes helpful prompts and call-to-action.

### Skeleton Screen
Loading state that shows the shape of content before it loads. Preferred over spinners.

### Toast
Brief notification message that appears and auto-dismisses. Used for confirmations and non-blocking errors.

### Modal / Dialog
Overlay UI for focused tasks like creating options, confirming actions, or viewing AI analysis.
